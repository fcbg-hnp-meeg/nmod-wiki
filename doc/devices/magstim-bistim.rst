Magstim BiStim²
===============

The `BiStim²`_ is a paired-pulse stimulator combining 2 monophasic stimulators to
deliver paired pulses through 2 separate or through a single coil. The paired pulses can
be delivered with independent stimulation intensities and variable inter-pulse intervals.

Magstim devices share common features that are detailed in the
:ref:`common features section of the guidelines <guidelines:Magstim devices>`.

.. note::

    Contrary to the `Super Rapid² Plus¹`_, the `BiStim²`_ power consumption is handled
    through a single power outlet.
