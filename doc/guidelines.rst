Guidelines
==========

Motor threshold
---------------

For TMS, the intensity of pulses is set as a percentage of the individual motor
threshold. The individual motor threshold varies greatly inter-subject, but also
intra-subject between separate sessions. Thus, the individual motor threshold should
**always** be re-estimated at the beginning of each session.

To prevent any risk for the participant, repetitive TMS is usually capped at 70 to 80%
of the individual motor threshold and single pulse TMS is usually capped at 120% of the
individual motor threshold.

Magstim devices
---------------

The Magstim devices share common features: similar interface design, similar coil
design, similar connector design.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

The interface has 3 buttons, green, yellow, and red, used to control the stimulation
pulses, and one nob used to set the stimulation settings.

- The green button is used to *charge* the devices.
- The yellow button is used to *deliver* a single pulse.
- The red button is used to *discharge* the devices.

.. attention::

    The Magstim devices should always be discharged before:

    - plugging/unplugging an antenna
    - shutting down the device

Antenna connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attention::

    When plugging or unplugging an antenna, extreme care should be taken to avoid
    bending the pins.

When plugging the connector, position it as straight as possible, insert it gently in
the correct orientation and tigheten the ring by turning it clockwise.

When unplugging the connector, untightened the ring by turning it counter-clockwise,
support the connector cable with one hand to avoid any stress on the pins and pull the
connector as straight as possible.
