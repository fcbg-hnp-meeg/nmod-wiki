Guidelines
==========

Motor threshold
---------------

For TMS, the intensity of pulses is set as a percentage of the individual motor
threshold. The individual motor threshold varies greatly inter-subject, but also
intra-subject between separate sessions. Thus, the individual motor threshold should
**always** be re-estimated at the beginning of each session.

To prevent any risk for the participant, repetitive TMS is usually capped at 70 to 80%
of the individual motor threshold and single pulse TMS is usually capped at 120% of the
individual motor threshold.

Magstim devices
---------------

The Magstim devices share common features: similar interface design, similar coil
design, similar connector design.

The interface has 3 buttons, green, yellow, and red, used to control the stimulation
pulses.

- The green button is used to *charge* the devices.
- The yellow button is used to *deliver* a single pulse.
- The red button is used to *discharge* the devices.

The nob is used to set the stimulation settings.
